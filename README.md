# Production-Grade Next.js course

My repo for the course Production-Grade Next.js by Scott Moss in Frontend Masters.
The course can be found [here](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/production-next/) and the content is briefly described below

>Take Next.js to the next level through building a production-ready, full-stack React app. Youâ€™ll add authentication to your app, add the ability to generate hundreds of pages performantly, preview your content, query a database, and use a CMS with Next.js. Then deploy your app to production using the Vercel platform. No matter if you're making a blog, marketing page, or a full-stack app, Next.js has the tools for you!
